### Generic smell configuration

# You can disable smells completely
InstanceVariableAssumption:
  enabled: false
PrimaDonnaMethod:
  enabled: false

# You can use filters to silence Reek warnings.
# Either because you simply disagree with Reek (we are not the police) or
# because you want to fix this at a later point in time.
#NestedIterators:
#  exclude:
#    - "MyWorker#self.class_method" # should be refactored
#    - "AnotherWorker#instance_method" # should be refactored as well
DuplicateMethodCall:
  exclude:
    - "QAT::Configuration" # are log.debug calls...

TooManyMethods:
  exclude:
    - "QAT::Configuration" # TODO: analyse possible refactoring

FeatureEnvy:
  exclude:
    - "QAT::Configuration#referenced_value" # TODO: analyse possible refactoring

# A lot of smells allow fine tuning their configuration. You can look up all available options
# in the corresponding smell documentation in /docs. In most cases you probably can just go
# with the defaults as documented in defaults.reek.

### Directory specific configuration

# You can configure smells on a per-directory base.
# E.g. the classic Rails case: controllers smell of NestedIterators (see /docs/Nested-Iterators.md) and
# helpers smell of UtilityFunction (see docs/Utility-Function.md)
#"web_app/app/controllers":
#  NestedIterators:
#    enabled: false
#"web_app/app/helpers":
#  UtilityFunction:
#    enabled: false
